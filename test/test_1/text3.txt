Citys breaking down on a camels back
They just have to go, cause they do not know wack
So while you fill the streets, its appealing to see
And you would not get out the county cause you are damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they have got to kiss me cause I do not get to sleep, no
